  abstract  = "The neighbour-joining method reconstructs phylogenies by
               iteratively joining pairs of nodes until a single node remains.
               The criterion for which pair of nodes to merge is based on both
               the distance between the pair and the average distance to the
               rest of the nodes. In this paper, we present a new search
               strategy for the optimisation criteria used for selecting the
               next pair to merge and we show empirically that the new search
               strategy is superior to other state-of-the-art neighbour-joining
               implementations.",
