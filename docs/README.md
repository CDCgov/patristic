## version

Type: [String][102]

### Examples

```javascript
console.log(patristic.version);
```

## Branch

A class for representing Branches in trees.
It's written predominantly for phylogenetic trees (hence the
[Newick parser][103],
[neighbor-joining implementation][104], etc.), but could
conceivably be useful for representing other types of trees as well.

### Parameters

-   `data` **[Object][105]?** An object containing data you wish to assign to
    this Branch object. In particular, intended to overwrite the default
    attributes of a Branch, namely `id`, `parent`, `length`, and `children`.
-   `children`  

### addChild

Adds a new child to this Branch

#### Parameters

-   `data` **([Branch][106] \| [Object][105])** The new Branch, or data to attach to it. (optional, default `{}`)

Returns **[Branch][106]** The (possibly new) child Branch

### addParent

Adds a new parent to this Branch. This is a bit esoteric and generally not
recommended.

#### Parameters

-   `data` **([Branch][106] \| [Object][105])** A Branch object, or the data to attach to one (optional, default `{}`)
-   `siblings` **[Array][107]** An array of Branches to be the children of the new parent Branch (i.e. siblings of this Branch) (optional, default `[]`)

Returns **[Branch][106]** The Branch on which this was called

### ancestors

Returns an array of Branches from this Branch to the root.
[d3-hierarchy compatibility method.][108]

Type: [Array][107]

### clone

Returns a deep clone of the Branch on which it is called. Note that this does
not clone all descendants, rather than providing references to the existing
descendant Branches.

Returns **[Branch][106]** A clone of the Branch on which it is called.

### copy

Returns a clone of the Branch on which it is called. Note that this also
clones all descendants, rather than providing references to the existing
descendant Branches. (For a shallow clone, see [Branch.clone][10].
Finally, the cloned Branch will become the root of the cloned tree, having a
parent of `null`.
[d3-hierarchy compatibility method.][109]

Returns **[Branch][106]** A clone of the Branch on which it is called.

### count

Sets the values of all nodes to be equal to the number of their descendants.

Returns **[Branch][106]** The Branch on which it was called

### descendants

Returns an array pf descendants, starting with this Branch.
[d3-hierarchy compatibility method.][110]

Type: [Array][107]

### depthOf

Returns the depth of a given child, relative to the Branch on which it is
called.

#### Parameters

-   `descendant` **([Branch][106] \| [String][102])** A descendant Branch (or `id` string
    thereof)

Returns **[Number][111]** The sum of the lengths of all Branches between the Branch on
which it is called and `descendant`. Throws an error if `descendant` is not a
descendant of this Branch.

### distanceBetween

Computes the patristic distance between `descendantA` and `descendantB`.

#### Parameters

-   `descendantA` **[Branch][106]** The Branch from which you wish to compute
    distance
-   `descendantB` **[Branch][106]** The Branch to which you wish to compute distance

this method is called.

#### Parameters

Returns **[number][111]** The patristic distance between `cousin` and the Branch on
this method is called.

Returns **[Branch][106]** The Branch on which it is called.

### fixParenthood

their parents, and correcting those references if they do not.

Returns **[Array][107]** An ordered Array of Branches following the path between this
Branch and `target`

### remove

Removes a Branch and its subtree from the tree. Similar to
[Branch.isolate][59], only it returns the root Branch of the tree
from which this Branch is removed.

Returns **[Branch][106]** The root of the remaining tree.

### reroot

Reroots a tree on this Branch. Use with caution, this returns the new root,
which should typically supplant the existing root Branch object, but does

```

Returns **[Branch][106]** The new root Branch, which is the Branch on which this was
called

### sort

Sorts the Tree from the branch on which it is called downward.

    a numberic value. For details, see [MDN Array.sort][122]

Returns **[Branch][106]** The Branch on which it was called

### sources

if `cousin` is a source of this Branch.

#### Parameters

-   `cousin` **[Branch][106]** The other Branch to test

Returns **[Boolean][116]** True if this might be the source of cousin, otherwise
false.

### sum

#### Parameters

-   `value` **[Function][113]** A Function taking a Branch and returning a
    (numeric?) value.

Returns **[Branch][106]** The Branch on which it was called.

Returns **[Boolean][116]** True if this might be the target of cousin, otherwise
false.

### toJSON

toJSON is an alias for [toObject][123], enabling the safe use of
`JSON.stringify` on Branch objects (in spite of their circular references).

Type: [Function][113]

Returns **[Object][105]** A serializable Object

### toMatrix

Computes a matrix of all patristic distances between all leaves which are
descendants of the Branch on which this method is called.

Array of `id`s corresponding to the rows (and columns) of the matrix.

### toNewick

Returns the Newick representation of this Branch and its descendants.

#### Parameters

-   `nonterminus` **[Boolean][116]** Is this not the terminus of the
    Newick Tree? This should be falsy when called by a user (i.e. you). It's
    used internally to decide whether or not in include a semicolon in the
    returned string. (optional, default `falsy`)

Returns **[String][102]** The [Newick][124]
representation of the Branch.

### toObject

Returns a simple Javascript object version of this Branch and its
descendants. This is useful in cases where you want to serialize the tree
(e.g. `JSON.stringify(tree)`) but can't because the tree contains circular
references (for simplicity, elegance, and performance reasons, each Branch
tracks both its children and its parent).

Returns **[Object][105]** A serializable bare Javascript Object representing this
Branch and its descendants.

### toString

Returns a valid JSON-string version of this Branch and its descendants.

#### Parameters

    for additional details.

Returns **[Object][105]** A valid JSON string representing this Branch and its
descendants.

## parseJSON

Parses a hierarchical JSON string (or Object) as a Branch object.

### Parameters

    representing hierarchical data.
-   `idLabel` **[String][102]** The key used in the objects of `json` to
    indicate their identifiers. (optional, default `"id"`)
-   `lengthLabel` **[String][102]** The key used in the objects of `json`
    to indicate their length. (optional, default `'length'`)
-   `childrenLabel` **[String][102]** The key used in the objects of
    `json` to indicate their children. (optional, default `` `children` ``)

Returns **[Branch][106]** The Branch representing the root of the hierarchy
represented by `json`.

This is adapted from Maciej Korzepa's [neighbor-joining][126],
which is released for modification under the [MIT License][127].
