## version

The [SemVer][87] version string of the patristic library

Type: [String][88]

### Examples

```javascript
console.log(patristic.version);
```

## Branch

A class for representing branches in trees.
It's written predominantly for phylogenetic trees (hence the
[Newick parser][89],
[neighbor-joining implementation][90], etc.), but could
conceivably be useful for representing other types of trees as well.

### Parameters

-   `data` **[Object][91]** An object containing data you wish to assign to
    this Branch object. In particular, intended to overwrite the default
    attributes of a Branch, namely `id`, `parent`, `length`, and `children`.

### addChild

Adds a new child to this Branch

#### Parameters

-   `data` **([Branch][92] \| [Object][91])** [description]

Returns **[Branch][92]** The (possibly new) child Branch

### addParent

Adds a new parent to this Branch. This is a bit esoteric and generally not
recommended.

#### Parameters

-   `data` **([Branch][92] \| [Object][91])** A Branch object, or the data to attach to one
-   `siblings` **[Array][93]** An array of Branches to be the children of the new parent branch (i.e. siblings of this Branch)

Returns **[Branch][92]** The Branch on which this was called

### ancestors

Returns an array of Branches from this node to the root.
d3-hierarchy compatibility method.

Type: [Array][93]

### clone

Returns a clone of the Branch on which it is called. Note that this also
clones all descendants, rather than providing references to the existing
descendant Branches.

Returns **[Branch][92]** A clone of the Branch on which it is called.

### copy

Returns a clone of the Branch on which it is called. Note that this also
clones all descendants, rather than providing references to the existing
descendant Branches. Finally, the cloned Branch will become the root of the
cloned tree, having a parent of `null`.

Returns **[Branch][92]** A clone of the Branch on which it is called.

### descendants

Returns an array pf descendants, starting with this node.
d3-hierarchy compatibility method.

Type: [Array][93]

### depthOf

Returns the depth of a given child, relative to the node on which it is
called.

#### Parameters

-   `descendant` **([Branch][92] \| [String][88])** A descendant Branch (or `id` string thereof)

Returns **[Number][94]** The sum of the all branches between the Branch on which it
is called and child. Return an error if `descendant` is not a descendant of
this Branch.

### distanceTo

Computes the patristic distance between `cousin` and the Branch on which
this method is called.

#### Parameters

-   `cousin` **[Branch][92]** The Branch to which you wish to compute distance

Returns **[number][94]** The patristic distance between `cousin` and the branch on
this method is called.

### each

Returns **[Branch][92]** The Branch on which it was called

### eachBefore

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order][97]

#### Parameters

-   `callback` **[Function][95]** [description]

Returns **\[type]** [description]

### eachChild

This is mostly a helper-function to Branch.each

#### Parameters

-   `callback` **[Function][95]** The function to run on each child.

Returns **[Branch][92]** The Branch on which it was called.

### excise

Excises the Branch on which it is called and updates its parent and children

Returns **[Branch][92]** The parent of the excised Branch.

### fixDistances

Sets the distance values (height and depth) for each Branch

Returns **\[type]** [description]

### fixParenthood

Repairs incorrect links by recurively confirming that children reference
their parents, and correcting those references if they do not.
If you need to call this, something has messed up the state of your tree
and you should be concerned about that. Just FYI. ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

#### Parameters

-   `nonrecursive` **[Boolean][98]** Should this just fix the children of the
    node on which it is called, or all descendants?

Returns **([Branch][92] \| [undefined][99])** The desired child branch, or undefined if the
child doesn't exist.

### getDescendant

Given an id string, returns the descendant Branch with that ID, or undefined if it doesn't exist.

#### Parameters

-   `id` **[String][88]** The id string of the Branch to find

Returns **([Branch][92] \| [undefined][99])** The descendant Branch, or undefined if it doesn't exist

### getDescendants

from which this Branch is removed.

Returns **[Branch][92]** The root of the remaining tree.

### reroot

Reroots a tree on this Branch. Use with caution, this returns the new root,
which should typically supplant the existing root branch object, but does
not replace that root automatically.

#### Examples

```javascript

    (numeric?) value.

Returns **\[type]** [description]

### targets

if `cousin` is a target of this Branch.

#### Parameters

-   `cousin` **[Branch][92]** The other branch to test

Returns **[Boolean][98]** True if this might be the target of cousin, otherwise
false.

### toJSON

toJSON is an alias for [toObject][101], enabling the safe use of
`JSON.stringify` on Branch objects (in spite of their circular references).

Type: [Function][95]

Returns **[Object][91]** A serializable Object

### toMatrix

Array of `id`s corresponding to the rows (and columns) of the matrix.

### toNewick

Returns the Newick representation of this Branch and its descendants.

#### Parameters

-   `nonterminus` **[Boolean][98]** Is this not the terminus of the
    Newick Tree? This should be falsy when called by a user (i.e. you). It's
    used internally to decide whether or not in include a semicolon in the
    returned string. (optional, default `falsy`)

Returns **[String][88]** The [Newick][102]
representation of the Branch.

### toObject

Returns a simple Javascript object version of this Branch and its
descendants. This is useful in cases where you want to serialize the tree
(e.g. `JSON.stringify(tree)`) but can't because the tree contains circular
references (for simplicity, elegance, and performance reasons, each branch
tracks both its children and its parent).

Returns **[Object][91]** A serializable bare Javascript Object representing this
branch and its descendants.

## parseJSON

Parses a hierarchical JSON string (or Object) as a Branch object.

### Parameters

-   `idLabel` **[String][88]** The key used in the objects of `json` to
    indicate their identifiers. (optional, default `id`)
-   `lengthLabel` **[String][88]** The key used in the objects of `json`
    to indicate their length. (optional, default `length`)
-   `childrenLabel` **[String][88]** The key used in the objects of
    `json` to indicate their children. (optional, default `children`)

Returns **[Branch][92]** The Branch representing the root of the
hierarchy represented by the input JSON

## parseMatrix

-   `labels` **[Array][93]** An array of `n` strings, each corresponding to the values in matrix

Returns **[Branch][92]** A Branch object representing the root node of the tree inferred by neighbor joining on matrix

## parseNewick

Parses a Newick String and returns a Branch object representing the root
of the output Tree.
This is adapted Jason Davies' [newick.js][105],
which is released for modification under [the MIT License][104].
